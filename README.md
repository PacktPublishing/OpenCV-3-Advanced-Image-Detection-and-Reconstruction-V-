# OpenCV 3 - Advanced Image Detection and Reconstruction [Video]
This is the code repository for [OpenCV 3 - Advanced Image Detection and Reconstruction [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/opencv-3-advanced-image-detection-and-reconstruction-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788391184), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Making your applications see has never been easier with OpenCV. With it, you can teach your robot how to follow your cat, write a program to correctly identify the members of One Direction, or even help you find the right colors for your redecoration. OpenCV 3 Computer Vision Application Programming Solutions provides a complete introduction to the OpenCV library and explains how to build your first computer vision program. You will be presented with a variety of computer vision algorithms, and exposed to important concepts in image and video analysis, which will enable you to build your own computer vision applications. 

This video helps you to get started with the OpenCV library, and shows you how to install and deploy it to write effective computer vision applications following good programming practices. You will learn how to read and write images and manipulate their pixels. Different techniques for image enhancement and shape analysis will be presented. You will learn how to detect specific image features such as lines, circles, or corners. You will be introduced to the concepts of mathematical morphology and image filtering.
